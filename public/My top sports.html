<h1>The top sports for Ilia</h1>
<h2>My top 3 sports of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Sport climbing</h3>
<p>This is my favourite sport. My friend recommended it back in 2018 and I have been climbing since.</p>
<h3>Skiing</h3>
<p>The first time I tried skiing was when I was 3 years old, but I don't remember much. 
    In 2005, when I was 5 years old I went to skiing camp, in ski resort Gudauri. During camp time, 
    I fell in love with skiing and haven't missed a year without skiing.</p>
<h3>Swimming</h3>
<p>Swimming gives me feeling of flying, I feel like I am weightless and I can glide through skies.</p>
